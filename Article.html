            <h2>Returning back to “normal”</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="textSection">
        <p>As Covid restrictions ease in some countries a path to return back to “reality” is in the foreseeable future. Non-essential retail, bars, restaurants, cafeterias and many more and opening their doors once again to the public and the social media are being flooded with “It feels so good to return back to reality” posts. And of course from now on the prospect of reopening other facilities as well is perceived in an optimistic manner. For the purpose of this paper I am going to be focusing on the re-openinging of  higher education specifically. In some countries the first steps have been already carried out. A plethora of university students, as myself, cannot wait for the campuses to re-open, lectures to be carried out in person and opportunities to socialise with peers to commence again. A return to reality is much anticipated and wished upon. However, what happens to all of us who have benefited even the slightest from this new reality? All of us who returning back to what we knew as reality pre-covid would mean losing advantages that we have gained? Does this mean that we will be forced to lose these benefits? </p>
        <p>Let us further delve into this matter, in order to further understand its components. Undoubtedly, online teaching has its advantages and disadvantages. I will be focusing on the advantages for the sake of  stressing how these will be lost once a return to a full return to “reality” is achieved. I am sure, that being able to attend lectures and seminars away from the physical space of university is something that most of us appreciate from time to time. Having the opportunity to work on your own-pace, re-watch lectures, or even saving some time for commuting, saving money on transport or remote studying from a different country or city are some of these benefits. </p>
        <p>Another advantage of transferring university lectures and material online, that I have to admit that I was not completely aware of the importance, has been the opportunity to juggle both full time work and university. A few weeks ago I was attending an online lecture and as happens quite frequently, the professor expressed the desire for sessions to return back to the university amphitheatres and learning to be carried out as previously. A peer, found the podium to speak up and express his stance that he for example would not be able to attend university classes if that happens because he is working full time or that other students would not be able to attend classes because they could not afford to move to a new city to attend university classes. In other words, for some students transferring the learning online has gave them the opportunity to attend classes, an opportunity that they would not have had if things had were “normal”. And unfortunately, since one of the negative effects the pandemic is bound to leave our society on an economic crisis, the dimensions of this issue are growing. More and more students will need to work to help their families stay on float or even to support their studies.</p>
        <p>I do appreciate however that after a year of establishing online teaching as the means of education, on a global scale according to UNESCO  remote learning remains out of reach for at least 500 million students. The need for a return to face-to-face teaching is burning. However, why does this mean that all the progress that has undeniably taken place throughout this last year in the sector of digital learning be pulled away? Could we perhaps adopt concurrently an in-person and remote approach? Would this approach help combine both the positives of face-to-face and online learning? </p>
        <p>The answer seems quite obvious. If when the circumstances permit it in person teaching resumes, and the online procedure continues to run simultaneously, this would essentially be another step towards creating an education system that is characterised by equality, meritocracy and empowerment. The educational needs of students who do not have access to the means that are necessary for online learning to take place, could return to their educational settings and receive their rightful education and students who are not in a position to return to classrooms, amphitheatres and labs could pursue their education remotely via online learning. </p>
        <p>The result of the proposed would be to reduce the number of potential learners that are forced to abstain from the learning process due to external circumstances. In a multi-faceted situation offering flexibility and adaptability is key. The greater freedom of choice, flexibility of means, and variety of pathways that can lead to education the greater our chances as society to reach the goal of universal education. </p>
        <p>So, instead of wishing for our education to return back to “normal” we should all be wishing that our education grows and comes to form a new education, a combination of “pre-pandemic” and “pandemic” teaching and learning. Coming out of this hard past year, that has left families, economies, societies crumbled we are faced with a challenge. Will we disregard this black page in history and move forward as if nothing ever happened or will we embrace this unfortunate situation and take the advancements on in order to help us grow? I can only hope that by cherry-picking the positive form the negative impacts of the pandemic we can further develop as a society.</p>
